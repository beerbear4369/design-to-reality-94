## In Progress

- ðŸŸ¡ Planning Phase 4: Core Voice Interaction Logic
  - ðŸŸ¡ Designing mock backend service architecture
  - ðŸŸ¡ Planning REST and WebSocket implementation
  - ðŸŸ¡ Structuring conversation flow and audio processing

## Up Next

- Phase 4: Core Voice Interaction Logic Implementation
  - 4.1: Mock Backend Service Creation
    - Implement REST API endpoints (conversations, audio)
    - Create WebSocket server for real-time communication
    - Set up localStorage persistence for conversation history
  - 4.2: Audio Recording & Processing
    - Develop microphone access and recording functionality
    - Create audio analysis for visualization
    - Implement WAV format conversion
  - 4.3: Conversation UI Flow
    - Add "thinking" state indicators
    - Implement typed response animation
    - Create different visualization states for AI responses
  - 4.4: Front-end Integration
    - Connect UI components to mock services
    - Implement complete conversation flow
    - Add persistence for page refreshes
- Phase 5: Refinements, Styling, and Testing
  - Final UI adjustments
  - Comprehensive testing
  - Performance optimization

## Known Issues

- Session data isn't persisted between screens yet
- View Session History button is non-functional (placeholder only)
- Audio processing is using mock data rather than real microphone input

## Future Enhancements (Post MVP)

- Authentication and user profile features
- Network error handling and recovery
- Voice activity detection
- Session pause/resume functionality
- Interruption handling during AI responses
- Adaptive conversation prompts
- Integration with real backend services
- Offline capability
- PWA support for mobile installation
