- Audio playback from MP3 files with visualization
- Fallback mechanisms for browsers with limited audio support
- Unified audio visualization for both microphone input and AI response output
- Local storage service for session persistence
- Fixed audio visualization and playback issues for consistent user experience
- Refactored architecture to separate UI state from backend communication
  - SessionContext simplified to be pure state container
  - useConversation hook now manages all message handling
- Fixed concurrent audio response issues with the following improvements:
  - Enhanced session management and synchronization
  - Improved localStorage operations with validation
  - Fixed session ID consistency between components
  - Added better error handling and recovery mechanisms
- **MAJOR MILESTONE**: Backend Integration Complete!
  - Implemented RealApiClient for direct backend communication
  - Created backend service layer with type conversion and error handling
  - Updated session API service to use real backend with mock fallback
  - Verified backend connectivity and API endpoints working
  - Health check functionality implemented and tested
  - Session creation working with real backend API
- **NEW MILESTONE**: Automatic Session Ending Implementation Complete!
  - ✅ Enhanced API types to support sessionEnded and finalSummary fields
  - ✅ Updated RealApiClient to extract session ending data from backend responses
  - ✅ Modified KukuCoach component to detect automatic session ending
  - ✅ Implemented auto-navigation to summary page with session context
  - ✅ Enhanced SessionSummaryPage to display backend-provided summaries
  - ✅ Added session-ended UI state with appropriate visual feedback
  - ✅ Maintained backward compatibility with existing manual session ending
  - ✅ Added comprehensive logging and debugging support

## In Progress Features
- **Production Testing**: Ready for testing with backend that implements automatic session ending
  - Backend needs to return sessionEnded: true in API response
  - Backend needs to provide optional finalSummary field
  - All frontend infrastructure is ready and tested

## Major Design Decision
We have decided to switch from WebSocket-based communication to a REST API approach for several key reasons:

1. **Simpler Interaction Model**: Our primary use case follows a request-response pattern (send audio → get AI response), which aligns better with REST.

2. **Reduced Complexity**: WebSocket implementation introduced race conditions and state management challenges that caused bugs in the audio playback and visualization.

3. **More Predictable State Management**: The request → response pattern makes state transitions clearer and more predictable, improving reliability.

4. **Session-Based Architecture**: Using session IDs with each request provides sufficient context for the backend to maintain conversation history without persistent connections.

5. **Improved Separation of Concerns**: We've further refined our architecture to make SessionContext a pure state container focused on UI state only, with the useConversation hook being the sole interface for backend communication and message handling.

## Backend Integration Architecture
We implemented a hybrid approach for maximum reliability:

1. **Real Backend Integration**: Direct HTTP communication with the actual backend API
2. **Mock Fallback**: Graceful degradation to mock implementation when backend unavailable
3. **Health Checking**: Automatic backend health verification before API calls
4. **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript interfaces for backend communication
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly fallbacks
6. **Session Ending Support**: Full support for automatic session termination by backend

## Automatic Session Ending Features
1. **API Layer**: Complete support for sessionEnded and finalSummary fields
2. **UI Integration**: Seamless detection and handling of session ending
3. **Navigation**: Automatic transition to summary page with context preservation
4. **Summary Display**: Priority system for displaying backend vs generated summaries
5. **State Management**: New session-ended state with appropriate UI feedback
6. **Backward Compatibility**: Manual session ending still works as before

## Recent Bug Fixes
- Fixed a critical issue where multiple AI audio responses would play simultaneously when clicking the record button multiple times
- Resolved localStorage timing and race condition issues with the mock API implementation
- Enhanced session ID consistency between different components
- Added validation and recovery mechanisms for localStorage operations
- **NEW**: Implemented robust backend integration with proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- **NEW**: Added comprehensive automatic session ending detection and handling

## Next Steps
1. **Backend Testing**: Test automatic session ending with real backend implementation
2. **Edge Case Handling**: Handle network errors during session ending gracefully
3. **UI Polish**: Add loading states and better transitions for session ending
4. **Production Readiness**: 
   - Add retry logic for session ending detection
   - Implement proper user feedback for session transitions
   - Add analytics for session completion metrics
5. **Advanced Features**: 
   - Enhanced conversation history UI
   - Session summary generation improvements
   - User profile preferences
6. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize audio processing and API call efficiency
