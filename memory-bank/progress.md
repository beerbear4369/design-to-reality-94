  - Statistics dashboard with message counts, duration, and ratings
  - Mobile-optimized responsive design with touch-friendly interactions
  - Real-time conversation timeline with sender identification
  - Professional UI matching overall application design

### Data Persistence & Integrity
- ✅ **Database Consistency**: All session data properly persisted to Supabase
- ✅ **Message Count Tracking**: Real-time synchronization between memory and database
- ✅ **Session Summary Persistence**: localStorage backup with fallback mechanisms
- ✅ **Rating Persistence**: Immediate database saves with error recovery

## 🚨 Critical Bug Fixes

### Database Synchronization Issues - ✅ RESOLVED
1. **`message_count` Database Sync Fix**:
   - **Problem**: Message count not reliably saved during sessions
   - **Solution**: Implemented atomic helper functions (`update_message_count`, `set_message_count`)
   - **Verification**: Created and passed end-to-end test script
   - **Impact**: Guaranteed data integrity for session analytics

2. **Session Summary DB Fix**:
   - **Problem**: Auto-ended sessions not updating database status/summary
   - **Solution**: Added missing `db_service.end_session()` call in automatic wrap-up logic
   - **Impact**: All session endings now properly persist session data

### Audio & UI Issues - ✅ RESOLVED
- **Concurrent Audio Playback**: Fixed multiple AI responses playing simultaneously
- **LocalStorage Race Conditions**: Resolved timing and synchronization issues
- **Session ID Consistency**: Fixed session management across components
- **Audio Visualization**: Unified approach for recording and playback states
