# Project Progress

## Complete Features
- Base UI components (Button, Input, Dialog, etc.) using Shadcn/UI
- Main layout with routing between pages
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Authentication flow for coaches and users
- Session Context for conversation history and state management
- Audio recording with visualization using Web Audio API
- Error handling for media device access
- Microphone recording with Web Audio API
- Voice visualization reflecting audio levels in real-time
- Audio playback from MP3 files with visualization
- Fallback mechanisms for browsers with limited audio support
- Unified audio visualization for both microphone input and AI response output
- Local storage service for session persistence
- Fixed audio visualization and playback issues for consistent user experience
- Refactored architecture to separate UI state from backend communication
  - SessionContext simplified to be pure state container
  - useConversation hook now manages all message handling
- Fixed concurrent audio response issues with the following improvements:
  - Enhanced session management and synchronization
  - Improved localStorage operations with validation
  - Fixed session ID consistency between components
  - Added better error handling and recovery mechanisms

## In Progress Features
- REST API integration for backend communication
  - Implemented session-based API architecture
  - Created robust error recovery mechanisms
  - Added proper session lifecycle management
  - Prepared for integration with real backend services

## Major Design Decision
We have decided to switch from WebSocket-based communication to a REST API approach for several key reasons:

1. **Simpler Interaction Model**: Our primary use case follows a request-response pattern (send audio → get AI response), which aligns better with REST.

2. **Reduced Complexity**: WebSocket implementation introduced race conditions and state management challenges that caused bugs in the audio playback and visualization.

3. **More Predictable State Management**: The request → response pattern makes state transitions clearer and more predictable, improving reliability.

4. **Session-Based Architecture**: Using session IDs with each request provides sufficient context for the backend to maintain conversation history without persistent connections.

5. **Improved Separation of Concerns**: We've further refined our architecture to make SessionContext a pure state container focused on UI state only, with the useConversation hook being the sole interface for backend communication and message handling.

## Recent Bug Fixes
- Fixed a critical issue where multiple AI audio responses would play simultaneously when clicking the record button multiple times
- Resolved localStorage timing and race condition issues with the mock API implementation
- Enhanced session ID consistency between different components
- Added validation and recovery mechanisms for localStorage operations

## Next Steps
1. Complete testing of the revised architecture
2. Begin preparation for integration with real backend API:
   - Create API client interfaces that can switch between mock and real implementations
   - Document data structures for API requests/responses
   - Plan authentication integration
3. Implement production-ready error handling and user feedback
4. Enhance UX with loading states and better error messaging
