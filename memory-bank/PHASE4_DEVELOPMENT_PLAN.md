# Phase 4 Development Plan: Kuku Coach

## Overview

Phase 4 of the Kuku Coach application focuses on implementing the core voice interaction and conversation flow. This phase is divided into three main sub-phases:

1. Phase 4.1: Audio Recording & Processing
2. Phase 4.2: UI State Management
3. Phase 4.3: Conversation Flow

This document outlines the implementation plan for each sub-phase and tracks progress.

## Phase 4.1: Audio Recording & Processing

**Status: ✅ COMPLETED**

- ✅ Implemented Web Audio API for microphone capture
- ✅ Created `useAudioRecorder` hook with complete lifecycle management
- ✅ Added robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
- ✅ Implemented proper resource cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- ✅ Fixed audio trimming issues and improved recording quality

## Phase 4.2: UI State Management

**Status: ✅ COMPLETED**

- ✅ Added state management for recording process
- ✅ Implemented robust blob handling with useRef for state persistence
- ✅ Added proper UI state for recording, processing, and errors
- ✅ Enhanced error handling and recovery mechanisms
- ✅ Added audio level analysis for visualization

## Phase 4.3: Conversation Flow

**Status: ✅ COMPLETED**

### Implementation Details

1. **Session State Management**:
   - ✅ Created `SessionContext` with React Context API
   - ✅ Implemented session persistence with localStorage
   - ✅ Added session restoration on page refresh
   - ✅ Created message history management
   - ✅ Added state transitions (idle → recording → processing → responding)

2. **UI Components**:
   - ✅ Created `ThinkingIndicator` component
   - ✅ Enhanced `AIMessage` component with typing animation
   - ✅ Updated `KukuCoach` component to use session state
   - ✅ Added visual feedback for different conversation states

3. **Page Integration**:
   - ✅ Updated `StartSessionPage` to use `SessionContext`
   - ✅ Updated `ActiveSessionPage` to sync URL with session state
   - ✅ Updated `SessionSummaryPage` to display conversation summary

### Technical Implementation

- **SessionContext**: Central state management for the conversation
  - Manages session ID, messages, and status
  - Provides actions for starting/ending sessions and sending messages
  - Handles persistence with localStorage

- **ThinkingIndicator**: Shows when the AI is processing a response
  - Animated dots to indicate processing
  - Custom CSS animations via Tailwind utilities

- **AIMessage Enhancements**: 
  - Typing animation for AI responses
  - Blinking cursor during typing
  - Dynamic text display based on session state

### User Flow

1. User starts a new session
2. User clicks record button to start speaking
3. Voice visualization responds to audio levels
4. User stops recording
5. "Thinking" indicator appears
6. AI response appears with typing animation
7. User can continue the conversation
8. At end of session, user navigates to summary screen
9. User can rate the session and start a new one

## Next Steps

Now that Phase 4 is complete, we will move on to Phase 5:

1. **Backend Integration**:
   - Replace download functionality with backend API calls
   - Implement WebSocket for real-time communication
   - Add error handling for network failures

2. **UI Refinements**:
   - Polish animations and transitions
   - Improve error handling UI
   - Add instructions and tooltips

3. **Testing & Performance**:
   - Cross-browser testing
   - Mobile optimization
   - Performance measurements and improvements
