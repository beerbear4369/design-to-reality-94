# Active Context: Kuku Coach

## Current Focus

We are transitioning from UI implementation to core functionality development for the Kuku Coach application. The immediate focus is on:

1. Implementing the Core Voice Interaction Logic (Phase 4 of the Development Plan)
2. Creating a mock backend service that mirrors the proposed microservices architecture
3. Establishing real-time audio processing and visualization
4. Implementing the complete conversation flow with proper state management
5. Adding typed response animation and "thinking" state indicators

## Recent Changes

- Implemented all three main page components:
  - StartSessionPage: Landing page with "Start Session" button
  - ActiveSessionPage: Main interaction screen with voice visualization
  - SessionSummaryPage: Post-session summary with rating feature
- Enhanced the voice visualization component:
  - Added a fourth waveform with asymmetric peaks for more visual interest
  - Made the waveform more dynamic with higher amplitudes
  - Improved visibility with larger mask area and adjusted animation speeds
  - Fixed cropping issues with the wave peaks
- Completely styled the SessionSummaryPage to match the Figma design

## Current Decisions

- Mock backend implementation will include both REST API and WebSocket connections
- Conversation history will be persisted in localStorage for now
- We'll use a 2-second simulation for the AI "thinking" state
- We will implement the typed response animation using an existing library 
- No authentication or user profile features will be implemented in this phase
- Audio will be captured and formatted in WAV format

## Next Steps

The immediate implementation plan includes:

1. Create the mock backend service structure:
   - REST API endpoints for session and conversation management
   - WebSocket service for real-time audio communication
   - Local storage persistence layer for conversation history

2. Implement the audio recording and processing functionality:
   - Real-time audio capture with WebAudio API
   - Audio level analysis for visualization
   - Recording state management

3. Develop the conversation UI flow:
   - Visual state indicators for recording, thinking, responding
   - Typed response animation for AI messages
   - Different visualization colors during AI response

4. Connect the front-end components to the mock backend:
   - Session creation and management
   - Audio recording and transmission
   - Response handling and display

## Future Considerations (Post-Phase 4)

- Authentication and user profile implementation
- Network error handling and recovery
- Voice activity detection
- Session pause/resume functionality
- Interruption handling during AI responses
- Adaptive conversation prompts for engagement
- Transition to real backend services
