# Active Context: Kuku Coach

## Current Focus

We are currently in the UI implementation phase for the Kuku Coach frontend application. The immediate focus is on:

1. Completing and refining the three main screens according to the Figma designs
2. Improving the voice visualization components with more realistic styling
3. Implementing interactive elements like the star rating system
4. Setting up the transitions between screens with proper state management

## Recent Changes

- Implemented all three main page components:
  - StartSessionPage: Landing page with "Start Session" button
  - ActiveSessionPage: Main interaction screen with voice visualization
  - SessionSummaryPage: Post-session summary with rating feature
- Enhanced the voice visualization component:
  - Replaced the SVG glowing background with an image background
  - Kept the interactive waveform visualization functionality
- Completely styled the SessionSummaryPage to match the Figma design:
  - Added the interactive 5-star rating system
  - Implemented proper styling for cards and buttons
  - Created responsive layout with proper spacing

## Current Decisions

- We're using a combination of SVG and image elements for the voice visualization
- Rating state is maintained locally on the SessionSummaryPage for now
- We're implementing UI closely following the Figma design specifications
- We're using Tailwind CSS with exact color values from the design

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps include:

1. Implement proper state management to pass session data between screens
2. Connect the real microphone input to the voice visualization
3. Add animation for transitions between screens
4. Implement proper error handling and loading states

After completing these tasks:

1. Begin integration with the backend API for real voice processing
2. Implement session data storage and history functionality
3. Add user authentication and personalization features

## Active Considerations

- How to effectively pass session data between different components
- Best approach for storing and retrieving session history
- Performance optimization for the voice visualization component
- Accessibility considerations for the rating system and other interactive elements
- How to handle different screen sizes and device capabilities
