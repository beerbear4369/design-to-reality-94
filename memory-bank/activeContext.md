# Active Context: Kuku Coach

## Current Focus

We are currently focused on improving the voice interaction logic for the Kuku Coach application. The immediate focus is on:

1. Refining the audio recording implementation for reliability
2. Connecting the recording functionality to the backend API for processing
3. Establishing real-time audio recording and playback
4. Creating the complete conversation flow with proper state management
5. Adding typed response animation and "thinking" state indicators

## Recent Changes

- Implemented robust audio recording functionality:
  - Created `useAudioRecorder` hook with complete recording lifecycle
  - Added error handling for all recording phases
  - Implemented proper resource cleanup to prevent memory leaks
  - Added retry mechanisms to handle edge cases
  - Enhanced recording quality with audio constraints and higher bitrate
  - Fixed issues with audio trimming at the beginning of recording
  - Added processing state indicators for better UX
  - Implemented local download functionality for testing purposes

- Updated the KukuCoach component:
  - Integrated the audio recording hook
  - Added state management for recording process
  - Implemented robust blob handling with useRef for state persistence
  - Added proper UI state for recording, processing, and errors
  - Enhanced error handling and recovery mechanisms

- Fixed issues with MediaRecorder implementation:
  - Added delays before starting recording to prevent initial audio trimming
  - Implemented fallback processing if onstop event doesn't fire
  - Added requestData calls to ensure all audio is captured
  - Created progressive delays with exponential backoff for blob handling

## Current Decisions

- For production, the local audio download functionality will be replaced with backend API calls
- Audio data will be sent to the backend via WebSocket for real-time processing
- We'll use the recorded blob as the payload for API communication
- Mock backend implementation will include both REST API and WebSocket connections
- Conversation history will be persisted in localStorage for now
- We'll use a 2-second simulation for the AI "thinking" state
- We will implement the typed response animation using an existing library 
- No authentication or user profile features will be implemented in this phase
- Audio will be captured in WebM format (with Opus codec) for browser compatibility
- Voice visualization will respond to actual audio levels during recording

## Next Steps

The immediate implementation plan includes:

1. Connect audio recording to backend:
   - Replace download functionality with API calls
   - Send recorded audio blob to backend via WebSocket
   - Add proper error handling for network failures
   - Implement response processing for backend replies

2. Complete the conversation UI flow:
   - Implement visual state indicators for recording, thinking, responding
   - Add typed response animation for AI messages
   - Create different visualization states during AI response
   - Handle transitions between states seamlessly

3. Connect the front-end components to the mock backend:
   - Integrate WebSocket for real-time communication
   - Handle session creation and management
   - Implement audio recording and transmission
   - Process AI responses for display and playback

4. Implement session summarization and rating:
   - Generate and display session summaries
   - Process and display user ratings
   - Enable starting a new session from the summary screen

## Future Considerations (Post-Phase 4)

- Authentication and user profile implementation
- Network error handling and recovery
- Voice activity detection
- Session pause/resume functionality
- Interruption handling during AI responses
- Adaptive conversation prompts for engagement
- Transition to real backend services
