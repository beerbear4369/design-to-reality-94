# Active Context

## Current Focus
We are developing Kuku Coach, an AI-powered voice coaching application that helps users work through mental health challenges with an accessible interface. The application features a conversation-style interface where users speak to the AI coach and receive spoken responses, with appropriate visual feedback.

## Recent Accomplishments
- Completed the voice-to-voice conversation loop: user speaks → AI processes → AI responds with audio
- Implemented a unified audio visualization system that works for both:
  - Microphone input during user recording
  - Audio playback during AI response
- Resolved audio processing issues with proper cleanup of Web Audio API resources
- Set up mock backend responses with real MP3 files for testing
- Implemented fallbacks for when audio files can't be loaded

## Current Technical Context
- Using React (v18) with TypeScript and Vite
- Web Audio API for capturing and analyzing audio
- WebAudio AnalyserNode for generating frequency data for visualizations
- Audio recording uses MediaRecorder API
- Audio playback uses HTMLAudioElement with Web Audio API analysis
- We've created hooks for audio recording and audio level analysis
- Session state is managed through React Context with localStorage persistence

## Current Challenges
1. Audio visualization needs to work consistently across devices
2. The same visualization code needs to be reused for both microphone input and AI response playback
3. The Web Audio API requires careful resource management to avoid memory leaks
4. Proper fallback mechanisms are needed for different browser capabilities

## Next Steps
1. Connect to a real backend API for transcription and response generation
2. Improve visualization with more nuanced frequency analysis
3. Add voice emotion detection to enhance coaching responses
4. Implement proper audio caching and loading states
5. Build out the coaching methodology with specific interventions
