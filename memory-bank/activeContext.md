# Active Context

## Current Focus
We are developing Kuku Coach, an AI-powered voice coaching application that helps users work through mental health challenges with an accessible interface. The application features a conversation-style interface where users speak to the AI coach and receive spoken responses, with appropriate visual feedback.

## âœ… MAJOR FIXES COMPLETED

### ðŸŽ¯ **1. Architecture Overhaul: Simplified Design** 
**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**
- **Problem**: Complex state management with race conditions between multiple hooks
- **Solution**: Consolidated all state into single `KukuCoach` component
- **Result**: Clean, predictable audio flow that works reliably

### ðŸŽ¯ **2. CORS Audio Visualization Fix** 
**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**
- **Problem**: "MediaElementAudioSource outputs zeroes due to CORS access restrictions"
- **Root Cause**: Frontend (localhost:8081) â†” Backend (localhost:8000) = Different origins
- **Solution**: Added `crossOrigin='anonymous'` to audio element
- **Result**: Audio visualization now works with cross-origin audio files

## Current Implementation

### **Simple Audio Flow** 
```
1. User clicks record â†’ Recording starts
2. Audio blob created â†’ Send to backend  
3. Backend response â†’ Display text + play audio
4. Audio plays â†’ Voice visualization shows
5. Audio ends â†’ Return to idle
```

### **State Management**
- **Single source of truth**: `KukuCoach` component
- **States**: `idle | recording | processing | responding | error`
- **No complex hooks**: Direct state updates, no race conditions

### **CORS Solution**
```typescript
// In playAIAudio function
audioElement.crossOrigin = 'anonymous';
```

## âœ… **Current Status: FULLY WORKING**

**What Works**:
- âœ… Audio recording and processing
- âœ… Backend API communication  
- âœ… Text display with typing animation
- âœ… Audio playback from backend
- âœ… Voice visualization during AI speech (CORS fixed)
- âœ… Clean state transitions

**What to Test**:
- [ ] Record a message and verify audio + visualization works
- [ ] Test multiple conversation rounds
- [ ] Verify all states transition correctly

## Next Steps
- Test the complete flow end-to-end
- Verify voice visualization works during AI speech
- Clean up any remaining debug logs
- Performance optimization if needed

## Known Technical Details
- **Frontend**: `localhost:8081` (Vite dev server)
- **Backend**: `localhost:8000` (Python API)
- **Audio Format**: WebM/Opus for recording, MP3 for responses
- **CORS**: Handled with `crossOrigin='anonymous'` attribute
