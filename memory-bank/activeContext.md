# Active Context: Kuku Coach

## Current Focus

We are currently focused on improving the visual components and implementing the voice interaction logic for the Kuku Coach application. The immediate focus is on:

1. Enhancing the visual design of the voice visualization component
2. Implementing the mock backend services for audio processing and session management
3. Establishing real-time audio recording and playback
4. Creating the complete conversation flow with proper state management
5. Adding typed response animation and "thinking" state indicators

## Recent Changes

- Enhanced the voice visualization component:
  - Added a fourth waveform with asymmetric peaks for more visual interest
  - Made the waveform more dynamic with higher amplitudes
  - Improved visibility with larger mask area and adjusted animation speeds
  - Fixed cropping issues with the wave peaks
  - Started replacing the visualization background with an image component
  - Added detailed comments to explain the component's functionality
- Refactored the AIMessage component with improved styling using glass effect
- Updated the RecordingButton component with consistent sizing between states
- Created initial structures for the mock backend services:
  - API services for conversation and audio handling
  - WebSocket service for real-time communication
  - Storage service for persisting conversations

## Current Decisions

- Mock backend implementation will include both REST API and WebSocket connections
- Conversation history will be persisted in localStorage for now
- We'll use a 2-second simulation for the AI "thinking" state
- We will implement the typed response animation using an existing library 
- No authentication or user profile features will be implemented in this phase
- Audio will be captured and formatted in WAV format
- Voice visualization will use a background image instead of CSS gradients for better visual quality

## Next Steps

The immediate implementation plan includes:

1. Finish the audio recording and processing functionality:
   - Implement real-time audio capture with WebAudio API
   - Create audio level analysis for visualization
   - Connect the recording button to actual microphone input
   - Handle recording state transitions

2. Complete the conversation UI flow:
   - Implement visual state indicators for recording, thinking, responding
   - Add typed response animation for AI messages
   - Create different visualization states during AI response

3. Connect the front-end components to the mock backend:
   - Integrate WebSocket for real-time communication
   - Handle session creation and management
   - Implement audio recording and transmission
   - Process AI responses for display and playback

4. Implement session summarization and rating:
   - Generate mock session summaries
   - Process and display user ratings
   - Enable starting a new session from the summary screen

## Future Considerations (Post-Phase 4)

- Authentication and user profile implementation
- Network error handling and recovery
- Voice activity detection
- Session pause/resume functionality
- Interruption handling during AI responses
- Adaptive conversation prompts for engagement
- Transition to real backend services
