# Active Context: Kuku Coach

## Current Focus

We are currently in the initial phases of development (Phase 0-1) for the Kuku Coach frontend application. The immediate focus is on:

1. Completing the Memory Bank setup to document our project approach and decisions
2. Creating the basic UI scaffolding and routing structure
3. Implementing the first screen (Start Session / Landing Page)

## Recent Changes

- Initialized project setup with Vite, React, TypeScript, and Shadcn/UI
- Set up initial routing with React Router
- Established the Memory Bank documentation structure

## Current Decisions

- We're using React Router for navigation between the three main screens
- We'll use React Context API for state management initially
- We'll leverage the existing voice visualization components for the voice interaction part
- We're starting with mock/placeholder API calls for now

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps include:

1. Create the `StartSessionPage.tsx` component to implement the landing page
2. Update `App.tsx` to include the new routes
3. Style the landing page according to the Figma design

After completing the landing page, we will:

1. Create the `ActiveSessionPage.tsx` and `SessionSummaryPage.tsx` components
2. Implement basic navigation between screens

## Active Considerations

- How the voice recording and playback will work in detail
- How to handle API errors or connectivity issues
- What visual feedback to provide during recording and loading states
- How to optimize the audio processing for different devices and browsers
