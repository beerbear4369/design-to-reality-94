# Active Context

## Current Focus
We are developing Kuku Coach, an AI-powered voice coaching application that helps users work through mental health challenges with an accessible interface. The application features a conversation-style interface where users speak to the AI coach and receive spoken responses, with appropriate visual feedback.

## Recent Accomplishments
- Completed Stage 4 implementation: Frontend-Backend Integration
- Fixed audio visualization and playback issues
- Successfully implemented audio response handling
- Refactored the KukuCoach main component to improve reliability
- Made strategic decision to switch from WebSocket to REST API
- Fixed critical issues with session management and audio playback:
  - Resolved concurrent audio response bug that caused multiple responses to play simultaneously
  - Fixed localStorage timing and synchronization issues in the mock API
  - Enhanced session ID management for consistency throughout the application
  - Improved error recovery to handle edge cases

## Current Technical Context
- Using React (v18) with TypeScript and Vite
- Web Audio API for capturing and analyzing audio
- WebAudio AnalyserNode for generating frequency data for visualizations
- Audio recording uses MediaRecorder API
- Audio playback uses HTMLAudioElement with Web Audio API analysis
- Session-based REST API architecture for backend communication
- Local storage for session persistence during development
- Enhanced error handling and recovery for localStorage operations

## Architecture Changes
We've made significant architecture changes:

### Recent Implementation:
- Fixed session management between UI and API:
  - Enhanced the mock API session creation and verification
  - Improved localStorage operations with validation and retries
  - Added proper error handling and recovery for session operations
  - Ensured consistent session ID format across all components

### Previous Implementation:
- Separated UI state from backend communication:
  - Simplified SessionContext to focus only on session status and ID
  - Moved message storage and handling to useConversation hook
  - Made useConversation the sole interface for backend communication
  - Eliminated duplicate message handling that was causing multiple audio responses

## Next Steps
1. Complete thorough testing of our architecture changes
2. Prepare for integration with real backend API:
   - Create API client interfaces that can switch between mock and real implementations
   - Document standard data structures for API requests and responses
   - Prepare authentication integration
3. Enhance user experience:
   - Add loading states and better visual feedback
   - Improve error messaging and recovery options
4. Begin work on advanced features:
   - Conversation history UI
   - Session summary generation
   - User profile preferences

## Development Decisions
1. We prioritize a clean separation between UI state and API communication
2. Using a session-based architecture to maintain conversation context
3. Implementing proper error handling with recovery mechanisms
4. Making the application production-ready with predictable state transitions
5. Ensuring our mock implementations follow similar constraints as real APIs
