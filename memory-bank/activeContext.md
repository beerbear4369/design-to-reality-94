# Active Context: Kuku Coach

## Current Focus

We are currently focused on implementing the core conversation flow for the Kuku Coach application. The immediate focus is on:

1. State management for the conversation
2. Connecting UI components to session management
3. Integrating audio recording with the conversation flow
4. Creating visual feedback for all conversation states
5. Preparing for backend integration

## Recent Changes

- Implemented robust audio recording functionality (Phase 4.2):
  - Created `useAudioRecorder` hook with complete recording lifecycle
  - Added error handling for all recording phases
  - Implemented proper resource cleanup to prevent memory leaks
  - Added retry mechanisms to handle edge cases
  - Enhanced recording quality with audio constraints and higher bitrate
  - Fixed issues with audio trimming at the beginning of recording
  - Added processing state indicators for better UX
  - Implemented local download functionality for testing purposes

- Implemented conversation UI flow (Phase 4.3):
  - Created `SessionContext` for global state management
  - Implemented persistence of sessions with localStorage
  - Added `ThinkingIndicator` component for processing state
  - Enhanced `AIMessage` component with typing animation
  - Updated page components to integrate with SessionContext
  - Implemented proper message history management
  - Added state transitions between recording, thinking, and responding states
  - Connected audio recording to conversation flow

## Current Decisions

- Using React Context API for state management instead of Redux
- Sessions are currently preserved in localStorage
- Audio recording is downloaded locally for development but will be sent to the backend in production
- Message history is stored as part of the session
- Using typed animation for AI responses to improve user experience
- Different visual states are shown for recording, thinking, and responding
- AI responses are simulated for now but will be connected to the backend API
- Using session IDs in the URL for sharing and deep linking

## Next Steps

The immediate implementation plan includes:

1. Replace download functionality with backend API integration:
   - Send recorded audio blob to backend via WebSocket or REST
   - Add error handling for network failures
   - Process backend responses for display and playback
   - Implement proper loading states for network operations

2. Final UI refinements:
   - Polish animations and transitions
   - Add loading states for network operations
   - Improve error handling and recovery
   - Add instructions and help tooltips

3. Testing and performance optimization:
   - Test across different browsers
   - Optimize for mobile devices
   - Add error boundaries and fallbacks
   - Measure and improve performance metrics

## Future Considerations (Post-MVP)

- Authentication and user profile implementation
- Network error handling and recovery
- Voice activity detection
- Session pause/resume functionality
- Interruption handling during AI responses
- Adaptive conversation prompts for engagement
- Transition to real backend services
