# Project Brief: Kuku Coach

## 1. Project Name
Kuku Coach

## 2. Project Goal
To develop a highly interactive and user-friendly AI voice coaching assistant that operates seamlessly on web and mobile browsers. The application will facilitate voice-based coaching sessions between a user and an AI, manage session progression, and provide summaries of coaching interactions.

## 3. Core Functionality

*   **User Authentication/Guest Access:** (To be defined - assuming guest access for now)
*   **Session Initiation:** User can start a new coaching session.
*   **Voice Interaction:**
    *   User can record voice input.
    *   Frontend sends recorded audio to a backend AI coaching application.
    *   Backend processes the audio and returns an AI-generated voice response and its text transcription.
    *   Frontend plays the AI's voice response and displays the text.
*   **Visual Feedback:** Display a voice waveform/visualization during user speaking and AI playback (as shown in the design).
*   **Session Management:** Track the current session state.
*   **Session Termination:** User or AI can end the session.
*   **Session Summary:** Upon session completion, display a summary of the conversation and allow the user to rate their experience.
*   **Navigation:** Clear navigation between the start screen, active session screen, and summary screen.

## 4. Target Audience
Individuals seeking personal development, coaching, or a guided conversational AI experience.

## 5. Key Success Metrics (Examples - to be refined)

*   User engagement (e.g., average session duration, number of interactions per session).
*   Task completion rate (e.g., users successfully completing a coaching session and viewing a summary).
*   User satisfaction (e.g., ratings provided on the summary screen).
