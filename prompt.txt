Additional Clarifying Questions
UI Feedback During Recording:
Should we implement any visual timer or duration indicator during recording?-no
Would you like any additional UI indicators beyond the voice visualization (like a recording indicator light)?-no keep it simple now
Mock Response Behavior:
How variable should the mock AI responses be? (Fixed responses, random from a set, context-aware based on simple rules)
Should we simulate different response times to make it feel more realistic?--just create a response with some content to makesure app working
Voice Activity Detection:
Would you like to implement automatic recording stop after a certain period of silence?--not now
Should recording automatically start when voice is detected, or only on button press?--only leave it to button at the momend
Error Handling:
How should we handle potential recording permission issues (microphone access denied)?-prompt user to fix maybe
Should we handle device switching (e.g., if user connects/disconnects headphones during session)?--not now, keep this in mind for future refinement consideration

Session State Management:
Do you want the ability to pause/resume a session, or should sessions be continuous until ended?--in the future iteration, have this function. now not the focus.
Should session data persist if the user refreshes the page?--yes, at the backend, conversation history is maintened for a session, need to consider how to integrate so it works better

Proposed Ideas for Conversation Flow Handling
For handling pauses and interruptions in conversation flow, I propose several options:

Silence Detection:
Automatically stop recording after 2-3 seconds of silence--no
Display a "Still listening..." message if silence extends but recording continues--in future iteration
Provide visual feedback of silence detection (pulsing indicator)--no

Interruption Handling: not now
Allow user to interrupt AI response by pressing record button while AI is "speaking"
Visually indicate when interruption is possible
Fade out current AI response when interrupted

Conversation Pacing:
Implement a "thinking" state between user input and AI response--this is good, show "kuku is thinking" in the Response
Show typing indicators during AI response generation-no
Vary response timing based on message length for natural feel--no, set timeout for 1 human response to be 5 minutes max

Contextual Prompts:no
After long pauses, show subtle prompt suggestions ("Would you like to talk about...")
Provide gentle re-engagement prompts if session goes silent for too long
Include visual indicators for "your turn to speak" moments

Revised Implementation Plan
AudioRecorder Hook & Voice Visualization Integration:
Create a custom hook that captures real-time audio data
Perform audio analysis for amplitude/frequency data
Connect audio metrics to voice visualization component
Implement WAV format handling
Display voice visualization waveform in different color when AI respond

Mock Backend Service: (pls consider the backend integration doc and creat the mockup integration correctly)
Create a simulated API service with response delays
Build a collection of contextual mock responses
Implement session management with local storage


Conversation Flow Management:(pls consider the backend integration doc and repropose)
